## Overview

It was quite frustrating at first, creating this. I just came off of tutorial hell and this was my first project. I guess it's not a project but rather a mini-project I guess. Anyway, this was my first time building something on my own. Of course, looking at the docs. It was frustrating when I couldn't get the design right, but I and glad I stuck with it and now that I've completed it, I can say it was pretty fun. Although, it does need some cleaning up but I am too lazy to do it. I mean it works! 
Overall, it was quite a blast building this. Had fun!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

First, used Vite with react and updated all the files.
Then, installed TailwindCSS for styling.
Created a Figma design as it is easier to create it with it. Can't afford the Pro version so created it myself.
Then, I structured the file with divs.
After that, I styled it with Tailwind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned that working with utility-class like tailwind does make the styling "easier" but the code looks like spaghetti. There's so much taildwind code. I guess this is what happens when you work with utility-class.


### Continued development

I want to focus more on CSS and which properties to use cause half the time I am just searching for properties that will work.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I mean I definitely couldn't have done it without this.

## Acknowledgments

I will thank **myself** for believing in myself. Even when I wanted to procrastinate, I didn't (not a lot). And completed it within a day.
